# PeopleSimilarity
Peoplesimilarity is a project which focuses on identifying analogous historical figures. The idea is based on various factors which is used to find the similarity between public figures.



We divided the project into two parts
•	For new entity
  •	Creating the file based the name of entity
  •	Filling the information of the user
  •	Adding the information one by one in the file

•	For processing the comparisons
  •	Showing the available entities 
  •	Entering the name of entity for comparing
  •	Creating a new file that will store the comparison 
  •	Reading the file(created using the name) and 
    reading the other files of the available entities
  •	 Storing the relationship between the input and other entities with percentages.
